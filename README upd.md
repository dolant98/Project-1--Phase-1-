# Microsoft Movie Analysis

**Author:** Theresa Dolan

## Overview

This project evaluates the performance of different films at the box office.  The goal is to make a set of recommendations for Microsoft to use as they navigate their entry into the film industry. The analysis includes an assessment of recent box office data, including the production budget required to make a film, as well as the revenue generated.  The outcome is a set of three options ranging from low to high risk.  Risk is defined as the investment (production budget) required to make the film.  


### Business Problem

Microsoft has recently created a new movie studio and requires guidance on strategy for entering the film industry.  This includes an evaluation of the types of films which are doing best at the box office, as well as the investment required to make different types of films. High yielding films may require significant upfront investment.  An understanding of the risks in addition to the rewards is necessary.

### Data

### Results

The analysis shows that gross revenue trended downward just before and during the pandemic.  While industry experts expect a bounce in 2022, overall gross revenue remains lower than in previous years.

Additional analysis shows that there is variability of both production cost and box office revenue across movie genres.

The outcome includes three recommendations based on these preliminary findings:

### Next Steps

Next steps include: 
* Working with Microsoft to understand risk tolerance
* Collect more recent data to understand the most recent trends for Action, Animation, and Documentaries
* Determine proportion of revenue attributed to non-theatrical releases 
* Identify the estimated time to realize the ROI: production start to release date to box office proceeds providing a breakeven.
